1.  INTRODUCTION

1.1 purpose:


The software requirement specification document is specifically designed to delineate the boundaries of the healthcare Information system design and functionality.

Parties interested in this document would include but not be limited to the system owners the system uses the project manager and the design team.


1.2 Scope of document:


This document will identify the pertinent software products we will develop including a host  JAVA software supported and web-based patient, physician, and Ambulatory inputs/outputs and sensor driven inputs for real-time patient monitoring. The SRS will show that we will be utilizing SQL server and ASP for interfacing  with the inputs/outputs as well as have applets for the real-time acquisition of health data from remote source. Finally, utilizing the security attributes of XML,XSL and a secure socket layer in the protocal stack we hope to address the valid security concerns about the networking and transmission of confidential health care info.

In addition to the specific design components of this software, this document will make clear the design teams goals of creatinf value added software which not only correctly captures patient health
information ,but then efficiently stores it, sorted it, retrieval it, and delivers this critical care information where it is needed by health care professionals. The benefit of having accurate, complete, and timely
health information is that it will inevitably  save human lives.
This software is deliberately focused on medical records and the associated diagnostics.it is important to point out that this system which is life critical will not have cross functionality regarding appointment management, billing, or insurance functions, however diagnostic codes sets will do compliant with feferal law.

1.5 overview of document
 The software requirement specification will define and illustrate the overall project and its requirements both functional and non-functional.
In addition the srs will define the user and their respective characteristics as well any constrains to developments that the team has identified
The format of the SRS document will address the overall project first-including function and objectives in an overview. This section will also address how this software
interface with other legacy systems and /or diagnostic equipment connected to it.
